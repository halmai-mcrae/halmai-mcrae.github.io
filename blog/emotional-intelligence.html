        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to a persons ability to be aware of, express and control their emotions as well as the ability to understand or interpret, and respond to the emotions of others. Some examples of emotional intelligence would be being able to:	
            <ul>
                <li>Accept criticism and responsibility.</li>
                <li>Move on after making a mistake.</li>
                <li>Say no when you need to.</li>
                <li>Share your feelings.</li>
                <li>Solve problems in ways that benefit others.</li>
                <li>Perceive how others are feeling.</li>
                <li>Have empathy for other people.</li>
                <li>Have great listening skills.</li>
            </p></div>

            <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
            <p>Intelligence quotient(IQ) is measured by a test evaluating a persons cognitive ability to solve problems, use logic and grasp/communicate complex ideas.</p>
            <p>Emotional quotient(EQ) tests measure your ability to recognise emotion in yourself and others and to use that awareness to guide your actions and decision making.</p>

            <div class="blog-post">
                <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
                <p>Understanding emotions can be the key to better relationships, stronger communication skills and improved wellbeing.</p>
                <p>In a work environment, people with high EI usually make great co-workers and managers because of their ability to understand, empathise and connect with the people around them.</p>
                <p>Employers are placing increasing importance on emotional intelligence during the hiring process and it’s not hard to figure out why. I’m sure all of us have worked with a manager or co-worker who was volatile and hard to approach, and experienced the stress of dealing with that person when working on tasks that should be straightforward. Myself, and many others I know have left jobs, not because they didn’t enjoy their role, but because of the anxiety that stemmed from dealing with individuals at work.</p>

            <h3>If your emotional abilities aren’t in hand, if you don’t have self-awareness, if you are not able to manage your distressing emotions, if you can’t have empathy and have effective relationships, then no matter how smart you are, you are not going to get very far.
