    <h1>Foundations: A Reflection</h1>

      <h3>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as
        a result of the Core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first thing that comes to mind, I cannot help but compare my
        learning progress to other's within the cohort, despite understanding
        that everyone comes into this with different backgrounds and strengths.
        I know some have stronger technical skills while others are more
        comfortable with Core, but after seeing the quality of some of the work
        being produced, I find it difficult to be truly satisfied with my own. I
        still regularly fall down the hole of “I’m so behind and I will never
        catch up!” whenever I see someone sharing work ahead of where I am in
        the Sprint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I’m not a perfectionist, my “Am I good enough/Will I ever be
        good enough?” thinking tendencies really get in the way of progress.
        Especially in the last couple weeks, I’ve noticed after submitting my
        weeks work I cannot shake the anxious feeling that I might’ve missed a
        crucial aspect, even though that has never happened. I’ve been
        prioritising meditation morning and evening with the Calm app and have
        found this helpful for combating these intrusive automatic thought
        patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a more positive note, I’ve learnt how disciplined and determined I
        can be when it comes to learning. I didn’t think I could work this
        productively unsupervised and would enjoy it. I’ve overcome a few
        obstacles over the course of Foundations and have handled them better
        than I ever would’ve anticipated. I think this is due to the Core
        aspects of the curriculum, and the early problem solving methods we were
        required to implement. Although I still struggle with self doubt, I’m
        happy that I’m not afraid to ask for clarification or advice from my
        peers and facilitator.

      <h3>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        To me, self-awareness is possibly the most important part of learning to
        program. Being self-aware means that you can identify when you’re
        drifting from a Growth Mindset and aids in accurately reflecting on your
        work at the end of each week. It’s also helped me to isolate and improve
        on areas I feel deficient in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning requires empathy towards your own limitations and those of
        others you are learning alongside. Early on, I was beating myself up for
        needing to take breaks from sitting at my computer, or taking ample time
        to process new concepts. I now understand my learning process a little
        better, so although it may feel un-productive to make a 5th cup of tea
        or go for a walk in the middle of studying, it’s actually assisting my
        progression. Empathy is a very important aspect of effective teamwork,
        and approaching all situations from a place of kindness and genuine
        desire to reach a mutually beneficial solution creates a healthy,
        supportive learning environment. If someone asks for help and feels like
        a burden, they are less likely to ask for help in the future and will be
        less productive as a result.

      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Honestly, how much I can still learn about myself and others! I’m
        someone who’s done therapy on and off for the last decade and felt like
        I would breeze through the core concepts easily. I’m friendly,
        introspective and the majority of my interactions with people are
        positive, so wasn’t anticipating learning SO much from the Core skills.
        Examples are improving my active listening skills and also asking
        focused questions. It’s been surprising how effective it has been on my
        overall approach to learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem solving method I’ve implemented have helped my learning
        process, but I’ve found its transferred to other areas in my life too. I
        feel calmer and less anxious overall.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power of meditation and doing regular breathing exercises. I'd always assumed it wasn't for me and my
        tumultuous brain, but its been amazing for retaining focus, and keeping
        cool when things get frustrating.

      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the Core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        I wouldn’t say they were challenging as I really enjoyed all aspects of
        our core work. I think initially the challenging part for me was
        dedicating ample time. In the first couple weeks I was so immersed on
        the tech side and rushed through the Core skills, feeling like I didn’t
        have enough time to fully benefit from them. I was able to structure my
        week better and have a healthy mix of Core and Tech each day.

      <h3>
        Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much
        time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
        In a high-pressure environment where you need to absorb a lot of
        information and put it into practice quickly, focusing on concepts like
        Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset are crucial. For myself anyway. I
        honestly don’t think I would have made it through the course work if it
        was simply Tech focused. I wouldn’t have been capable of digging myself
        out of self-doubt and frustration.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m prone to stressing, so having Core skills included in the curriculum
        has given me opportunities for personal development and to check in with
        myself about how I’m actually feeling. It has made the process less
        daunting and clinical, if that makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most people, finding employment is the goal post EDA. Being aware of
        the core skills employers are seeking will make it easier to transition
        from training to work and make EDA students more desirable as potential
        candidates.

        Does the time you spent studying Core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Not at all! The concepts are super interesting and relevant. I have
        learned so much more about myself than I had anticipated and the process
        has helped me find the most effective way to engage the material.
        It has also allowed me to be kind and patient to myself when it came to
        assessing my own progress and ability to learn. I would suggest
        including more!
