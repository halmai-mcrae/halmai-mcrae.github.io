        <h1>Values & Identity</h1>
        <div class="blog-post">
        <h3>Describe your core personal values:</h3>
        <p>First and foremost, I’m very empathetic. I used to think it was somewhat of a limitation to spend so much time thinking about others perspectives and how they felt, but I gain so much knowledge and personal satisfaction from understanding others. I’ve been in countless situations where empathy has been shown to me, and I love continuing that cycle. A lot of difficult situations people encounter can be eased by being empathetic.</p>
        <p>I learnt from a young age how important being honest and dependable is. I highly value being someone that people can rely on and approach without judgment.</p>
        <p>I'm principled in a way that shines through when I'm speaking about something I'm passionate about. I'm definitely proud of my conviction when it comes to social issues or injustice.</p>
        <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p>I grew up without much guidance, I wasn't able to process trauma and learned pretty much all of life’s lessons through making mistakes. But it did make me learn some of the harsher lessons fast, and eventually my collective experiences made me a better person. I left home at 15, and my older sister took on a parental role for me, and was someone I could approach with any problem without fear of reprehension. She was always solutions based, kind and patient with me. We travelled the world together and lived in many different cities, and have been fortunate in every location to turn the friends we made into family.</p>

            <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development:</h3>
            <p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Curiosity:</strong>I’m eager to learn, and not always in a conventional way. I have always enjoyed finding out about new concepts and technology, and combining it with discussion and exploration with others.</p>
            <p><strong>Patience:</strong>Not something I developed overnight, but as I approach my thirties I find it much easier to trust the process of working towards my goals, even if it sometimes seems tedious or I deal with setbacks.</p>
            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Teamwork:</strong>Although I enjoy working closely with others, sometimes I find in group setting I can be slow to speak up or put forward ideas.  I understand that won’t work well continuing into Bootcamp and will focus on being more accountable in that area.</p>
            <p><strong>Time management:</strong> I wouldn’t necessarily say I’m a perfectionist but I like doing things to the best of my ability, which can sometimes lead to  burn out or them taking much longer than they should.</p>
