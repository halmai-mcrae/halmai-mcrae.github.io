        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <div class="blog-post">
        <h3> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>To be perfectly honest, I'm not entirely sure at this stage. I've known for a while that I really wanted to learn how to code, and that EDA looked like a fantastic option for that. It was a huge accomplishment to even apply for something that felt so out of my comfort zone. Completing Foundations and Bootcamp to the best of my ability is certainly the short term goal, and I'm enjoying the personal development I'm already experiencing. I was prepared for it to be intense at times, but I didn't realise how much fun I would have.
            I know that I want to seek a career path that aligns with my values rather than one that offers status and material gain. To feel fulfilled in a career I would have to be helping and connecting with people on some level. I don't want a career that doesn't take personal needs into consideration, is overly repetitious, or promotes conflict. I have always been geared towards non-fixed pathways, and have been lucky to find roles that are a fit for me in various industries. </p></div>

                <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning:</h3>
                <p>I have always intrinsically valued any opportunity to learn or up skill. I gain deep personal satisfaction when I understand a concept that was previously foreign to me. This is enhanced when I can apply a learned skill to my own life or to assist others. When I’m interested in something I can research and learn about it for hours without feeling exhausted.</p>
                    <p>I can communicate effectively. Whether I’m asking for help or clarifying something for someone else.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy learning through discussion and practice with other people who are also motivated, however this leads me into some of my limitations.</p>
                    <p>I can be slow to contribute within group settings, I think this is a general anxiety/imposter syndrome symptom. Even if I’m certain I understand something I am often reluctant to speak about it, especially to others that may be more knowledgable. I feel like this will arise in Foundations and Bootcamp and I want to be conscious about it. Although, I can be sensitive to criticism, being told I am incorrect or off track is definitely better than feeling like I have let people I’m working with down, or haven’t adequately contributed to a group project.
                    <p>I can also compare myself too harshly to others when I’m in a group setting. If I feel like I am not keeping up I can become frantic and make simple mistakes because of it.</p></p></div>

                    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
                    <p>As outlined above, I definitely want to build more confidence in my abilities, and confidence when it comes to sharing projects or things about myself. I think building confidence would also help with not comparing myself to others. I'm also far less likely to procrastinate if I'm certain I'm competent.</p>
                    <p>I would love to get better at planning. I love making lists and ticking off accomplishments but lack appropriately planning the time and resources I need to actually achieve goals.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-post">
                        <h3>Managing the workload:</h3>
                        <p>I feel confident asking for help or advice from my facilitator and will continue to do that. I will request feedback often.</p>
                        <p>I will be patient and open-minded when presented with concepts I don't understand.</p>
                        <p>I am still gaining knowledge on how I study most productively. Thoroughly planning my day with regular breaks to avoid brain block has been working well recently, and I would like to use a time tracker regularly to avoid spending too much time on problems and feeling stuck, or like I’ve diverted from the main objective.</p>
                        <p>Practising mindfulness isn’t something I'm naturally inclined towards, but I think I would benefit greatly from breathing exercises or guided meditation during my breaks to ensure I’m coming back to a period of study feeling refreshed.</p>
                        <p>I have always understood the importance of a quality nights sleep and fuelling my body and brain with nourishing food. Although since beginning Foundations I have notice a drop in my physical activity, which often happens when my schedule changes drastically. With adequate planning I’m sure I can fit in some physical activity and self care, which will definitely help when I’m switching off my brain for the evening.</p></div>

                            <h3>Commitment for seeking help:</h3>
                            <p>If after following my problem solving process, I am still stuck on something I will reach out right away, whether to other students or my facilitator. From my understanding of the EDA program, it seems difficult to catch up if you have fallen behind, so I will be proactive about seeking help if I feel as though I am.</p></div>

                                <h3>Expectations from facilitators:</h3>
                                <p><ul><li>To be supportive and clear when providing feedback.</li>
                                    <li>Be available for check-ins each week.</li>
                                    <li>Help me to identify further strengths and limitations I might have.</li>
                                    <li>To guide me towards solutions when I am stuck.</li>
