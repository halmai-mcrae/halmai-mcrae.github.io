<h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
<div class="blog-post">
    <h3>Neuroplasticity:</h3>
    <p>Neuroplasticity refers to your brain’s ability to adapt when it recognises the need to. We used to believe that the brain became fixed after a certain age, but more recent research has revealed that the brain possesses an amazing capacity to develop new abilities, create new connections and never stops changing in response to learning.</p>
    <p>Understanding the concept of neuroplasticity has an overall positive effect on motivation, achievement, and brain activity. It can help people develop a growth mindset rather than fixed mindset(which I’ll elaborate on later) which can encourage approaching problems or things they find difficult, with curiosity and patience rather than internalised negativity. </p>
    <p>I found it extremely encouraging to understand that, with some time and patience, the brain can actually be rewired- which may help with learning, certain mental health symptoms and protect against cognitive decline. I first delved into neuroplasticity in EDA’s prep curriculum, and am so happy that it was presented there. I think without understanding the principles, I would have begun Foundations very differently.</p>
    <p>It is so important for people to understand that the capabilities and knowledge they already possess, is not what they are limited to.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Some ways to increase your neuroplasticity:</h3>
    <ul><li>Tap into existing pathways: Do further research about things you're intrested or involved in.</li>
        <li>Keep practising: Repeating an activity builds stronger, more hardwired connections in the brain.</li>
        <li>Video games:<a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2013120>Yes, really!</a></li>
        <li>Exercise regularly: Physical exercise boosts the part of the brain responsible for motor control and learning.</li>
        <li>Remind yourself about neuroplasticity and how the brain works!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Growth Mindset:</h3>
    <p>People who believe their skills can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and patience) have what’s known as a growth mindset.</p>
    <p>They tend to achieve more than those with fixed mindset (those who believe their skills are limited to what they are already good at). </p>

    <h3>Things that surprised me in this exploration:</h3>
    <p>Learning about how much mindset plays into achieving was extremely eye-opening and encouraging. I found the <a href=https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-459099>Ted Talk</a> included in Sprint 4 resources, about educating students on growth mindset and “The Yet, or Not Yet” method of grading to be really moving and indicative of how important it is in correlation to learning.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>How I will be implementing growth mindset into my learning:</h3>
    <p>In many ways I have been, but there is always room for improvement. I definitely struggle with confidence and the research on growth mindset indicates that communicating or discussing newly learned things can increase confidence in your abilities. I also need to understand that struggling is normal and not to be villainized as it’s the first step to learning. </p>
