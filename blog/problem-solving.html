    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <div class="blog-post">
      <h3>
        A time where I got blocked on a simple problem AND solved it in an
        elegant way:
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think I can combine these two instances, although I’m not sure I can
        refer to any of my methods as ‘elegant’ just yet. However, I was proud
        of myself for unknowingly using a good problem solving technique!
      </p>
      <p>
        During Sprint 3, I was working through the Intro to JavaScript challenge
        and had been progressing pretty well for my level. I reached the final
        question in JavaScript conditionals, where we were told not to use an
        if/else statement and to use a switch statement instead. I did some
        research on switch statements and although I understood what they were
        and when they should be used, I kept looking at the problem and not
        feeling confident on where to start.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d checked Slack but no one had asked a question in regards to it which
        confirmed that it may not be as complicated as I felt it was. I probably
        should have taken a short break (it was reaching a point in the
        afternoon where my brain likes to switch off), but it was the last
        question in the section and I was determined to figure it out. I felt
        frustration building and messaged my brother who has excellent knowledge
        of JavaScript and could explain how to execute them in a way I might
        understand, but his status was telling me he was away from his desk.
      </p>
      <p>
        I figured it could be a while until he got back to me, and I was already
        growing embarrassed about the empty line where my code should’ve been.
        So I wanted to order my thoughts, be able to describe the problem to him
        clearly and also tell him what I’d attempted(which was nothing at this
        point). So I cleared my mind, re-read the question and resources, and
        wrote out what I thought it could be, but still thinking I was off. He
        messaged me back in that very moment. I console logged it and it was
        correct!
      </p>

      <p>
        He called me, to debrief and discuss, and told me the method I'd used
        was pretty much The Rubber Ducky method! It was comforting to hear that
        him and his workmates still use it often at their level. I will
        definitely be getting myself a rubber ducky for my workspace to explain
        things to.

      <h3>Pseudocode:</h3>
      <p>
        Pseudocode is a technique of writing programming code in plain English
        to be read by humans(as in, yourself and other programmers). It’s
        written as a simple step by step process as a comment in your code. Your
        computer won’t pay attention to it but it can be extremely helpful when
        writing trickier code, as it breaks down a project into smaller more
        manageable steps and also keeps you focused on what you wanted the code
        to achieve.
      </p>
      <p>
        When first hearing about pseudocode I was like “No”. It sounded like too
        much typing, a waste of time and I thought having more words in my
        editor would stress me out, leading to confusion. I used it plenty of
        times during the Katas challenges, and found it super helpful for the
        reasons I outlined above, and also I didn’t have to keep checking the
        Sprint curriculum to confirm I was on track. It will be helpful when
        collaborating with others too.
      </p>
      <h3>Trying something:</h3>
      <p>Pretty self explanatory.</p>
      <p>
        I am definitely not shy to jump in and try something I think might work.
        What I do need to work on is actually noting down what I’ve tried, so
        I’m not just mashing my keyboard with the same incorrect attempt.
      </p>
      <h3>Rubber Ducky method:</h3>
      <p>
        The idea is that when a programmer has an issue with their code, they
        should explain the issue to a rubber duck. Often, the act of explaining
        the problem step by step will cause the solution to present itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been using the rubber ducky method unknowingly since starting at
        EDA. Unfortunately, I don’t have a physical rubber ducky just yet, but
        my brother, cat and partner have all been excellent stand ins. I even
        rubber ducky’d to myself in the mirror once.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe I just like the sound of my own voice, or maybe it’s the adorable
        name this problem solving technique has! Also this concept shouldn’t
        just be confined to programming- rubber ducking can definitely be
        applied to other areas in life.
      </p>
      <h3>Reading error messages:</h3>
      <p>
        In programming these can look really aggressive and intimidating. I read
        them all as red messages saying “YOU SUCK!”.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you get over that, error messages contain important information
        that can guide you toward what needs to be amended. Whether it’s a
        simple syntax error or something bigger, paying attention to error
        messages can lead you to a solution.
      </p>
      <h3>Console.logging:</h3>
      <p>
        Console logging is a very basic way to diagnose and troubleshoot minor
        issues in your code. The console. log() is a function in JavaScript
        which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to
        just print any message that needs to be displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first approached console.logging similar to the way I did pseudocode.
        It seemed pointless when I could refresh the page to see what had
        changed. I now know that it’s an extremely helpful developer tool and
        allows you to see if the code is executing correctly at any stage.
      </p>
      <h3>Google:</h3>
      <p>
        My two biggest pet-peeves are when people interrupt what I’m doing to
        show me a YouTube video, and hearing people hypothesise over something
        that could be easily Googled.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve used it multiple times daily since beginning EDA and while it’s
        extremely helpful, occasionally in programming it can lead you down a
        rabbit hole. The curriculum included strategic ways to Google things
        which has helped, and there’s a few sites I look for on the results
        page(Stackoverflow, MDN, W3, Geeks for Geeks) which usually make it
        faster to find exactly what I’m searching for.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking your peers or coaches for help:</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve learnt so much from my peers in the Foundations Slack channel!
        Although I’ve only made my own ‘help post’ once or twice, I’m super
        thankful to the others that are ahead of me for posting their issues,
        and to the people that assist them. My facilitator Emily is awesome, so
        far I’ve mostly relied on her for moral support and confirmation I’m on
        the right track, but I wouldn’t hesitate to message her if I’d exhausted
        my other problem solving avenues or needed further clarity on something.
      </p>
      <h3>Improving your process with reflection:</h3>
      <p>
        I knew there was something I was missing. I'm definitely not
        prioritising reflection enough. I think its a combo of sometimes not
        being certain my methods are the best/correct, and also experiencing
        burn out by the end of the day when studying.
      </p>
      <p>
        I usually reflect on my own work when I have to(I reflected o Sprint 3
        before starting Katas this sprint). I think I should try to reflect on
        what I’ve learnt in the middle of the study day, perhaps before or after
        I take a meal break. Thanks for the reminder!
