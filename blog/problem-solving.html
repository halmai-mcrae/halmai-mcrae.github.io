    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <div class="blog-post">
    <h3>A time where I got blocked on a simple problem AND solved it in an elegant way:</h3>
    <p>I think I can combine these two instances, although I’m not sure I can refer to any of my methods as ‘elegant’ just yet. However, I was proud of myself for unknowingly using a good problem solving technique!
    </p>
    <p>During Sprint 3, I was working through the Intro to JavaScript challenge and had been progressing pretty well for my level. I reached the final question in JavaScript conditionals, where we were told not to use an if/else statement and to use a switch statement instead. I did some research on switch statements and although I understood what they were and when they should be used, I kept looking at the problem and not feeling confident on where to start. 
    </p>
    <p>I’d checked Slack but no one had asked a question in regards to it which confirmed that it may not be as complicated as I felt it was. I probably should have taken a short break (it was reaching a point in the afternoon where my brain likes to switch off), but it was the last question in the section and I was determined to figure it out. I felt frustration building and messaged my brother who has excellent knowledge of JavaScript and could explain how to execute them in a way I might understand, but his status was telling me he was away from his desk. 
    </p>
    <p>I figured it could be a while until he got back to me, and I was already growing embarrassed about the empty line where my code should’ve been. So I wanted to order my thoughts, be able to describe the problem to him clearly and also tell him what I’d attempted(which was nothing at this point). So I cleared my mind, re-read the question and resources, and wrote out what I thought it could be, but still thinking I was off. He messaged me back in that very moment. I console logged it and it was correct!</p>

    <p>He called me, to debrief and discuss, and told me the method I'd used was pretty much The Rubber Ducky method! It was comforting to hear that him and his workmates still use it often at their level. I will definitely be getting myself a rubber ducky for my workspace to explain things to.</p>
